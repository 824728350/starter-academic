Hi there! I'm Richard Yiming Qiu, a first year CS Ph.D student at Rice University working with Prof. Ang Chen. My current research focus is on Network Configuration Verfication and Cross Platform Performance Predictions, leveraging a wide variety of methodologies such as program synthesis, symbolic execution, graph analysis, constraint solving and machine learning. 
It is an honor to live in an era of change, witnessing the fast advance of information technology. Please feel free to contact me is you are intersted in my reasearch, I would love to chat more with you :)
